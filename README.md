A template for react web apps with support for GitHub pages.

**OverReact** adds:
+ Bootstrap
+ Font awesome
+ Routes (and a basic configuration)
+ Prop types
+ SASS

It also includes some basic examples of the added components.

To **deploy** your own **GitHub page** you have to:
- Change the "homepage" attribute in `package.json`
- Change `Routes.pageTitle` (src > config > routes.js)

Start up
---------
```
> yarn
> yarn start // to test the app
> yarn run deploy // uploads the app to your github pages repo
```
